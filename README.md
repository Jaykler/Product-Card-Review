## Welcome

Hi thereüôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, My name is Hilda, you can call me Jaykler. I've completed the front-end mentor challenge and created the component to look as close as possible to the design provided, made it responsive to web and mobile devices, following best practices, and focused on minute details.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Most of the CSS stuff, ive forgotten, and this chanllge helped me refresh my mind by forcing me to use @Media Query. It's a 
Here's a sample of it: when using @media remember this is just to set the responsive part for different screen sizes. 

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    .container {
      padding: 0;
      flex-direction: column;
      width: 350px;
      height:600px;
    } 
}
```
There could be an easiest way to do it, but im currently on the learning path. 

### Continued development

As mentioned above, when I used @media, I felt like I had a hard time understanding how it works. However, I'll keep practicing. 

### Useful resources

- I'll recommend to anyone to check out [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) for doubts when working with @media.
